### Interview

Satish >> <b><i>Welcome, Jyotsna and thanks for taking out time to share your thoughts.
For the benefit of the readers of this blog could you please introduce yourself and tell us what you do for a living?</i></b>

<b>Jyotsna >></b> Hi, I am Jyotsna, a software developer at CoffeeBeans Consulting and working on a recommendation engine at my workplace.<br>
Also an Open source enthusiast, I am an active contributor at Mozilla as a Mozilla Representative.

Satish >> <b><i>It's so great to know that open source excites you so much.
I am glad to know that your projects have been an interesting demonstration of Golang.
Do you have any advice for a student or beginners getting into open source?</i></b>

<b>Jyotsna >></b> Most of the students out there know about Open Source, but often they don't have the right direction to get involved with it. Few of them think that Open source contribution is only about coding.
When I joined Mozilla, I wasn't even aware that this is my baby step towards Open Source world too.<br>
The foremost challenge is to find a project as per your skill-set and interests. Also, lack of proper documentation is a major drawback when a rookie enters into Open Source projects.<br>
I'm an Open Source mentor at `Rethink Passion`, where I help students from Tier-2 and Tier-3 colleges to get started with Open source contributions. Being involved with Mozilla, I feel that the easiest way to step into the Open Source world is through Mozilla, where it's not about coders, it's about people who are passionate about Open Source regardless of their interests.

Be it a coder, or a designer, or an evangelist, there's always a way to contribute to Open Source.

Satish >> <b><i>That's really nice Jyotsna. I am glad to see the recent rise in Open source culture in India and hopefully, if this trend goes on then we all would learn a lot from this.
Can you tell us a bit about your projects in Golang? </i></b>

<b>Jyotsna >></b> I have got my hands dirty in Golang at my current workplace. They gave me the wonderful opportunity to dive deep into Golang.

Satish >> <b><i>That’s interesting Jyotsna. So when did you start working on Go and why?</i></b>

<b>Jyotsna >></b> CoffeeBeans had asked me to pick either from Python/Django or Golang project. CoffeeBeans doesn’t dump any technology upon you. They are considerate about their employee’s interest and I’m fortunate enough to be part of it and have the chance to learn Golang while working upon it.

Satish >> <b><i>How excited are you about GopherConIndia?</i></b>

<b>Jyotsna >></b> This will be my first Golang talk. As I generally give talks on Open Source and Cross Browser WebExtension, I’m quite excited and nervous about Golang talk.<br>
It is amazing to see the Gopher community evolving like other tech communities, and it would be great to interact with them.

Satish >> <b><i>Do you have any other suggestions for our readers?</i></b>

<b>Jyotsna >></b> Follow fellow contributors, see what they are doing, find mentors who can help you out, Google everything before you nudge your mentors to help you out.<br>
This is not rocket science. Communicate more and keep the flame of curiosity and knowledge burning within you. That’s how you learn and grow.
