### About Speaker

Karthic Rao is an entrepreneur, developer, musician, blogger and a passionate learner. With his significant core contributions to <b><i>Caddy</i></b> (Nginx alternative written in Go) and <b><i>Minio</i></b> (Amazon S3 alternative written in Go) Karthic's primary tech expertise revolves around building high performance and cost effective infrastructure + analytical tools and pipelines. His expertise stems from his experience of working with startups across Silicon valley in the west to Singapore in the east.

He is going to speak about <b><i>Gopher in Infraland</i></b>.<br>
When not at work he might be found performing with <b><i>Piano / Boxing / Trekking / Motorcycle trips</i></b>.

### Interview

Me >> <b><i>Welcome, Karthic and thanks for taking out time to share your thoughts.
For the benefit of the readers of this blog could you please introduce yourself and tell us what you do for a living?</i></b>

<b>Karthic >></b> Yes, Definitely. As you know now I'm Karthic Rao, I hail from this remote village called Bangadi, its located alongside the western ghats belt of Karnataka. I work at the intersection of Product-Business-Data-Scale.

I'm the founder of `Kredaro`, an early stage startup focussed on building products around <u>solving Real time + Batch Analytics and Machine Learning challenges</u> at scale. When its aligned with our product goals we also offer services and we work with multiple enterprises and startups, we build the entire data pipeline of storing and consuming data, training ML/DL model and build micro services to consume the trained model at any scale, at times I also train engineers at enterprises, that's what I primarily do for living.

Apart from work, I've been performing <b><i>Piano</i></b> for around 15 years now, I've been closely involved with various open source communities and have made impactful contributions to many open source projects, I do technical writing and have written over 275+ articles, I enjoy high intensity workouts like <b><i>cross fit and boxing, meditation and going on motorcycle trips</i></b>.

Me >> <b><i>It's so great to know that open source excites you so much. I am glad to know that your projects have been an interesting demonstration of Golang. Do you have any advice for a student or beginners getting into open source?</i></b>

<b>Karthic >></b> Yes. `Getting Started` is the toughest part of actively contributing to an open source project. Its always better to get started with an early stage project which has got less attention from the community, folks from such projects would be more willing to help you out in warming up and get actively involved. Such projects would also have a wide open opportunities to contribute.<br>
One can get started by contributing to docs, writing blogs and helping make the tests better and eventually crawl towards the core of the project. That's what I still do when I get started with a new project. If one of these projects become really big it could be life changing for you. My contributions to `Caddy` paved way for big career opportunities, it led me to work with valley based startup `Minio` and now with startups across the globe, it could indeed be life changing.

Me >> <b><i>That's really nice Karthic. I am glad to see the recent rise in Open source culture in India and hopefully, if this trend goes on then we all would learn a lot from this. Can you tell us a bit about your projects in Golang?</i></b>

<b>Karthic >></b> Sure. [Caddy Server](https://caddyserver.com) and [Minio](www.minio.io) have been the Go based open source projects to which I've made significant contributions to.<br>
<b><i>Caddy</i></b> is an Nginx alternative and <b><i>Minio</i></b> is Amazon S3 alternative both written in Go. This experience of using Go for building infrastructure technologies lead me to build multiple products at various startups and eventually build a team and start on our own.

Me >> <b><i>That’s cool Karthic, your projects are interesting. So when did you start working on Go and why?</i></b>

<b>Karthic >></b> Around late 2014, I first came across Go. Back in college I used to mostly develop in C and C++ for writing Linux device drivers and system programs. But in the first set of startups I worked with, I got to use Node.js and Python to write server side code.<br>
Coming from C/C++ world I was never a fan of scripting languages for server side development, especially Node.js. There were multiple challenges I had encountered while writing server side code for scale, I always felt that effort involved in producing a quality server side software could be reduced, application of concurrency could be made simpler for developers, deployment could be made easier with just a binary,  testing and benchmarking tools could be made simpler to use so that developers would write more tests and benchmark them often.<br>
Go nailed it all! So it inevitably become the first choice for server side development.

Me >> <b><i>How excited are you about GopherConIndia?</i></b>

<b>Karthic >></b> I'm really excited about the conference, The experience of being at Gophercon India's past editions has been great, this time its been held at Goa also adds onto the excitement.<br>
Looking forward to meet the community and interact with them at the conference.

Me >> <b><i>Do you have any other suggestions for our readers?</i></b>

<b>Karthic >></b> Well, if you haven't yet explored, don't wait, `Go for Go` and try to make it to the conference :)
