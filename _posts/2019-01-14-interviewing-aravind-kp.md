### About Speaker

Aravind KP is a Software Engineer at Hashnode. He got into Go because he wanted to learn more about containers and it soon became his primary tool and companion. He loves OSS and you can find his code in many projects. At the moment, he is exploring the blockchain world and taking seasonal detours to OSS and some Kubernetes clusters.<br>

He is going to speak about <b><i>Forget Cloud Computing, Blockchain Is The Future</i></b>.<br>
When AFK, you can find him <b><i>on a basketball court or napping in his bed</i></b>.

### Interview

Me >> <b><i>Welcome Aravind and thanks for taking out time to share your thoughts.
For the benefit of the readers of this blog could you please introduce yourself and tell us what you do for a living?</i></b>

<b>Aravind >></b> Hey Satish, Thanks for having me. I’m currently working as a Software Engineer at `Hashnode`. Prior to that, I’ve co-founded a startup where I worked on building a technical hiring platform, but unfortunately, the product was not a success. I love learning and tinkering with new technologies.

Me >> <b><i>It’s so great to know that open source excites you so much. I am glad to know that your projects have been an interesting demonstration of Golang. Do you have any advice for a student or beginners getting into open source?</i></b>

<b>Aravind >></b> In the light of my experience, contributing to open source has always been fun for me. It has taught me many important lessons. The people that I interacted with were very helpful and so nice.<br>
I started contributing to `Go projects` when I was a beginner. You can imagine the mistakes that I could make, but there were people who took their time to review my code and help me rectify my mistakes. I’m extremely thankful to each and every one of them. The ones I had the opportunity to work with were very open-hearted, nice and kind but I’ve heard some people have had bad experiences as well.<br>
I would recommend people contribute to projects which have a welcoming community and a good code of conduct. Luckily, most of the Go projects have it. If you are a beginner looking to make your first contribution, I would suggest you look at the [Go GitHub API](https://github.com/google/go-github) repository.

Me >> <b><i>That’s really nice Aravind. I am glad to see the recent rise in Open source culture in India and hopefully, if this trend goes on then we all would learn a lot from this. Can you tell us a bit about your projects in Golang?</i></b>

<b>Aravind >></b> Containers were the thing that brought me into Go and this is reflected in the contributions that I make. I’m not a member of any of the OSS communities but I’ve contributed fixes to many projects including <b><i>Athens, Helm, Tendermint, Kubernetes etc</i></b>.<br>
The product that I built at my startup was also written in Go and It used the `docker-engine API` extensively. Right now I’m exploring some <b><u>Blockchain projects</u></b>, which are very interesting and built on Go.


Me >> <b><i>That’s cool Aravind, your projects are interesting. So when did you start working on Go and why?</i></b>

<b>Aravind >></b> Back in 2014, I was in college attending a security conference and the presenter introduced a hot new technology called `Docker`. I was truly astonished and started digging deeper into it. This led me to Go and since then it has been my tool of choice.

Me >> <b><i>How excited are you about GopherConIndia?</i></b>

<b>Aravind >></b> This Gophercon is very special to me, and something which is going to stay close to my heart. This is the first time I’m going to speak on such a big stage. I’m equally nervous and excited.

Me >> <b><i>Do you have any other suggestions for our readers?</i></b>

<b>Aravind >></b> I humbly ask the readers to come to my talk and I’ll be happy to answer any questions they might have either in person or online. You can reach out to me `@scriptonist` almost everywhere. Satish, thank you very much for this interview. Thank you for all those reading and hope to see you all at Gophercon.
