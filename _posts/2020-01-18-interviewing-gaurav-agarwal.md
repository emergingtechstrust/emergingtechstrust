### Interview

Me >> <b><i>Welcome Gaurav and thanks for taking out time to share your thoughts.
For the benefit of the readers of this blog could you please introduce yourself and tell us what you do for a living?</i></b>


<b>Aravind >></b> Hi Satish, thanks for having me here.<br>
My name is Gaurav Agarwal. I have worked as a Consultant/Software Engineer previously at ThoughtWorks, BrowserStack and at Tarka Labs.<br>
After having worked on a dozen programming languages professionally, I decided to start a consulting and training firm under the name of _agarwalconsulting.io_. Apart from this, I have been co-organising the Chennai Go meetups and Golang India remote study groups and been contributing to open source projects as part of those initiatives.

Me >> <b><i>It’s so great to know that open source excites you so much. I am glad to know that your projects have been an interesting demonstration of Golang. Do you have any advice for a student or beginners getting into open source?</i></b>

<b>Aravind >></b> I have been looking into _GoKit_ lately, which is a framework for building distributed and scalable webapps in Go. I consider myself as a learner, and have been reading more on internals of Go.

Me >> <b><i>That’s really nice Gaurav. I am glad to see the recent rise in Open Source culture in India and hopefully, if this trend goes on then we all would learn a lot from this. Can you tell us a bit about your projects in Golang?</i></b>

<b>Aravind >></b> I have built FaaS apps using Go predominantly cause of its low boot times.

Me >> <b><i>That’s cool Gaurav, your projects are interesting. So when did you start working on Go and why?</i></b>

<b>Aravind >></b> I was introduced to Go in 2013, though I didn’t take it seriously back then. I then went on to simulate UDP traffic to gauge packet drops using Go cause in 2014 Go was (still is) by far the simplest and most scalable language to design for such kind of use cases.

Me >> <b><i>How excited are you about GopherConIndia?</i></b>

<b>Aravind >></b> GopherConIndia provides a platform to meet so many like minded people working in Go. In spite of being in Chennai, I don’t get to meet some of the folks from there as often as I meet them at GopherConIndia. The talks lineup is great and I can’t wait to see what exciting things this conference brings.

Me >> <b><i>Do you have any other suggestions for our readers?</i></b>

<b>Aravind >></b> If you are interested in talking about Go from the comfort of your home, no matter what your skill level is, you would want to take a look at [Go Study Group India](https://github.com/golangindia/studygroup){:target="_blank"}.
